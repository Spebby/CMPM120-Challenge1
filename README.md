# What is this?

This is the first "Challenge Assignment" in CMPM-120 for Winter '25 @ UCSC. This is essentially an attendence check.

This challenge focused on introducing Phaser's scene workflow & sending some data cross-scene. The work done is only visible in the dev console, so have that open if you visit the website.

These are public per prof's instructions.
